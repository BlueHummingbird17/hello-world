Walk through of git hub intro manual

My eyes are a litte sandy from how late it is here; my screen seems too bright and the music is a little too loud but I am doing exactly what I want to do be doing on a late weekday night like this one. Working on my skill set, a little slower than I would like but a little feels better than nothing at all.
